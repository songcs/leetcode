Here, pre is the previous node. Since the head doesn't have a previous node, I just use self instead. Again, a is the current node and b is the next node.

To go from ***pre -> a -> b -> b.next*** to ***pre -> b -> a -> b.next***, we need to change those three references. Instead of thinking about in what order I change them, I just change all three at once.

```python
def swapPairs(self, head):
    pre, pre.next = self, head
    while pre.next and pre.next.next:
        a = pre.next
        b = a.next
        pre.next, b.next, a.next = b, a, b.next
        pre = a
    return self.next
```
