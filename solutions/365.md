If a or b is negative this means we are emptying a jug of x or y gallons respectively.

Similarly if a or b is positive this means we are filling a jug of x or y gallons respectively.

x = 4, y = 6, z = 8.

GCD(4, 6) = 2

8 is multiple of 2

so this input is valid and we have:

-1 * 4 + 6 * 2 = 8

In this case, there is a solution obtained by filling the 6 gallon jug twice and emptying the 4 gallon jug once. (Solution. Fill the 6 gallon jug and empty 4 gallons to the 4 gallon jug. Empty the 4 gallon jug. Now empty the remaining two gallons from the 6 gallon jug to the 4 gallon jug. Next refill the 6 gallon jug. This gives 8 gallons in the end)

            y = x%y
