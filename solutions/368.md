# 解法二
My S[x] is the largest subset with x as the largest element, i.e., the subset of all divisors of x in the input. With S[-1] = emptyset as useful base case. Since divisibility is transitive, a multiple x of some divisor d is also a multiple of all elements in S[d], so it's not necessary to explicitly test divisibility of x by all elements in S[d]. Testing x % d suffices.

While storing entire subsets isn't super efficient, it's also not that bad. To extend a subset, the new element must be divisible by all elements in it, meaning it must be at least twice as large as the largest element in it. So with the 31-bit integers we have here, the largest possible set has size 31 (containing all powers of 2).
