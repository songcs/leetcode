We just need to remember how many empty slots we have during the process.

Initially we have one ( for the root ).

for each node we check if we still have empty slots to put it in.

a null node occupies one slot.
a non-null node occupies one slot before he creates two more. the net gain is one.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder):
        """
        :type preorder: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # remember how many empty slots we have
        # non-null nodes occupy one slot but create two new slots
        # null nodes occupy one slot
        
        p = preorder.split(',')
        
        #initially we have one empty slot to put the root in it
        slot = 1
        for node in p:
            
            # no empty slot to put the current node
            if slot == 0: return False
                
            # a null node?
            if node == '#':
                # ocuppy slot
                slot -= 1
            else:
                # create new slot
                slot += 1
        
        #we don't allow empty slots at the end
        return slot==0
```
