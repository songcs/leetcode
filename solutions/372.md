One knowledge: ab % k = (a%k)(b%k)%k
Since the power here is an array, we'd better handle it digit by digit.
One observation:
a^1234567 % k = (a^1234560 % k) * (a^7 % k) % k = (a^123456 % k)^10 % k * (a^7 % k) % k
Looks complicated? Let me put it other way:
Suppose f(a, b) calculates a^b % k; Then translate above formula to using f :
f(a,1234567) = f(a, 1234560) * f(a, 7) % k = f(f(a, 123456),10) * f(a,7)%k;

1337 only has two divisors 7 and 191 exclusive 1 and itself, so judge if a has a divisor of 7 or 191, and note that 7 and 191 are prime numbers, phi of them is itself - 1, then we can use the Euler's theorem, see it on wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_theorem, it's just Fermat's little theorem if the mod n is prime.

see how 1140 is calculated out:
phi(1337) = phi(7) * phi(191) = 6 * 190 = 1140

Today, seeing @myanonymos 's comments, and I find several days ago I AC it just by fortunate coincidence, it's not the best solution. now I get a better idea.

(1) Firstly, if a has both divisor 7 and 191, that's a % 1337 == 0, answer is 0.
(2) Then if a has neither divisor 7 nor 191, that's a and 1337 are coprime, so ab % 1337 = ab % phi(1337) % 1337 = ab % 1140 % 1337.

(3) Finally, a could has either divisor 7 or 191, that's similar.
Let it be 7 for example.
Let a = 7nx
and let b = 1140p + q, where 0 < q <= 1140
then:

ab % 1337
= ((7nx)b) % 1337
= (7nbxb) % 1337
= ( (7nb % 1337) * (xb % 1337) ) % 1337
= ( (71140np + nq % 1337) * (x1140p + q % 1337) ) % 1337

now note x and 1337 are coprime, so

= ( (71140np + nq % 1337) * (xq % 1337) ) % 1337
= ( 7 * (71140np + nq - 1 % 191) * (xq % 1337) ) % 1337

note 7 and 191 are coprime too, and 1140 is a multiple of 190, where 190 = phi(191). What's more we should assure that q != 0, if b % 1140== 0, then let b = 1140. so

= ( 7 * (7nq - 1 % 191) * (xq % 1337) ) % 1337
= ( (7nq % 1337) * (xq % 1337) ) % 1337
= (7nqxq) % 1337
= ((7nx)q) % 1337
= (aq) % 1337

now you see condition (2) and (3) can be merged as one solution, if you take care of when b % 1440 == 0, and let b += 1140. Actually (1) can be merged too, but not efficient.
